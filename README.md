# react-typescript-vscode
This is a very basic project demonstrating how a project can be setup to enable React.js development in Typescript and Visual Code, including debugging functionality in VS Code.

* Clone
* Open in Visual Studio Code
* `npm install`
* `npm run build` - this compiles the Typescript do the **dist** folder and puts a watch on to perform automatic recompile on changes.
* `npm run start` - this starts the **webpack-dev-server** to serve the webpage in a normal browser tab.
* Close the tab
* VS Code -> Debug tab -> **Launch web** - this opens the project in a separate web browser instance in debug mode. You should no be able to test the web page and set breakpoints in VS Code as you see fit.
